## Schedule view

<Note>
  eCW's schedule view is accessible from **Practice**
  <Icon icon="move-right" iconType="solid" /> **Provider**.
</Note>

When viewing the schedule, Akomi automatically reads the schedule data from the screen and displays a comprehensive list of all patients, highlighting which ones have existing records in our system. You can also view each patient's authorization status at a glance.

## Patient view

<Note>
  The patient view is visible whenever the Patients Hub is open. You can access
  Patient Hub by searching for a patient, or clicking on an encounter in the
  schedule view.
</Note>

To view details for a specific patient or initiate an authorization request, double-click on any encounter in schedule view.
The Akomi side panel will automatically adjust to display the encounter view, showing the patient's details and providing an option to create an authorization request.
