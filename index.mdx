description: "Akomi eliminates the administrative burden of prior authorizations for healthcare providers.  What typically takes 10–20 minutes per patient can now be completed in under 5 seconds. Akomi uses advanced AI to extract clinical evidence from your EHR, validate it against payer guidelines, respond to authorization questions, and submit requests via portals or phone—entirely autonomously. The entire process is seamlessly initiated from within your existing EHR workflow."

## Getting Started

Currently, Akomi is available by invitation only. To request access, email [shivam@akomihealth.com](mailto:shivam@akomihealth.com). If your organization already uses Akomi, reach out to your system administrator for an invite.

### Creating an Account

You will receive an invitation email from `notifications@akomi.com`. Click the link in the email to accept the invitation and create your account.

If you’ve been invited by your administrator but didn’t receive the email, go to https://app.akomi.com/auth and sign up using the same email address to which the invitation was sent.

### Installing the Akomi Plugin in Your EHR

<Info>
  Akomi's support team will help you download and configure the chrome extension. The chrome extension is required for creating authorization requests from your EHR.

### Submitting authorization requests

You can think of Akomi's EHR plugin like a authorization copilot attached to your EHR. It responds, and adapts based on the current screen displayed in your EHR. For the purposes of this document, we will use eCW as an example, but Akomi works with any EHR (however, the specific pages on which patient details are displayed may vary, contact our support for further questions).

As soon as you open a patients chart or page, Akomi's plugin on the right side will display the option to create an authorization request. The only thing needed to submit a request is the CPT codes you want to authorize. Akomi will automatically pull the patient demographics, insurance and clinical evidence from your EMR. As you see in the `screenshot above` you can pre-configure common procedures and CPT codes to allow for quickly creating authorization requests. Read `this documentation` to learn how to create CPT code bundles for quick creation.

You can also manually type out the exact list of codes (in a comma separated list) you'd like authorized, if the existing mappings don't cover the encounter.
