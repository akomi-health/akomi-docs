description: "Akomi eliminates the administrative burden of prior authorizations for healthcare providers.  What typically takes 10–20 minutes per patient can now be completed in under 5 seconds. Akomi uses advanced AI to extract clinical evidence from your EHR, validate it against payer guidelines, respond to authorization questions, and submit requests via portals or phone—entirely autonomously. The entire process is seamlessly initiated from within your existing EHR workflow."

## Getting Started

Currently, Akomi is available by invitation only. To request access, email [shivam@akomihealth.com](mailto:shivam@akomihealth.com). If your organization already uses Akomi, reach out to your system administrator for an invite.

### Creating an Account

You will receive an invitation email from `notifications@akomi.com`. Click the link in the email to accept the invitation and create your account.

If you’ve been invited by your administrator but didn’t receive the email, go to https://app.akomi.com/auth and sign up using the same email address to which the invitation was sent.
