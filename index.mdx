## Getting Started

Akomi is currently available by invitation only. To request access, email [contact@akomi.com](mailto:contact@akomi.com). If your organization already uses Akomi, please reach out to your system administrator for an invitation.

### Creating an Account

You will receive an invitation email from `notifications@akomi.com`. Click the link in the email to accept your invitation and create your account.

If you have been invited by your administrator but did not receive the email, visit [https://app.akomi.com/auth](https://app.akomi.com/auth) and sign up using the same email address to which the invitation was sent.

### Installing the Akomi Plugin in Your EHR

<Info>
  The Akomi support team will assist you in downloading and configuring the
  Chrome extension. This extension is required to create authorization requests
  directly from your EHR.
</Info>

### Submitting Authorization Requests

Think of Akomi's EHR plugin as an authorization copilot integrated with your EHR. It responds and adapts based on the current screen displayed in your EHR. For this guide, we use eCW as an example, but Akomi works with any EHR. (The specific pages where patient details appear may varyâ€”contact our support team if you have questions.)

When you open a patient's chart, the Akomi plugin appears on the right side, offering the option to create an authorization request. All you need to submit a request are the CPT codes you wish to authorize. Akomi automatically pulls patient demographics, insurance details, and clinical evidence from your EMR. As shown in the [screenshot above](#akomi-plugin-screenshot), you can pre-configure common procedures and CPT codes for quick selection.

  CPT bundles let you group commonly used procedure codes together for fast,
  easy selection.

You can also manually enter any set of codes (as a comma-separated list) you'd like authorized, if the existing mappings don't cover the encounter.
