Akomi submits your prior authorizations through the same portals that your staff uses today, just like a human would. Akomi also accesses your EMR in the same way a human would to collect the necessary demographic and clinical information. For this reason, Akomi requires login credentials for each of your portals and your EHR.

<Info>
  Someone from Akomi's customer success team will collect the necessary
  credentials from you. **Please use the email and phone number provided by
  Akomi for all account creation.**
</Info>

# I. Providing Access to Your EMR

Akomi requires access to your EMR to collect the necessary demographic and clinical information. Please ensure that you provide sufficient access to allow Akomi to:

1. View patient demographics and encounter data
2. View and download both locked and unlocked progress notes
3. View and download other documents in the patient's chart

Once you create the credentials, log into your Akomi account and add them under **Settings** <Icon icon="move-right" iconType="solid" /> **Task Creation** <Icon icon="move-right" iconType="solid" /> **EHR Credentials**.

# II. Providing Access to Insurance Portals

Depending on your payer mix and the different procedures you authorize in your practice, Akomi may need access to some, all, or additional portals beyond those listed below. Once you create credentials for any of these portals, add them to your Akomi account under **Settings** <Icon icon="move-right" iconType="solid" /> **Auth Setup** <Icon icon="move-right" iconType="solid" /> **Insurance Portals Setup**.

<Info>
  When adding credentials, you can ignore the [2FA and Review before
  submit](https://share.cleanshot.com/hml3Bv7q) options.
