Akomi submits your prior authorizations just like a human would, through the same portals that your staff uses today. Akomi also
accesses your EMR just the way a human would to collect the necessary demographic and clinical information.
For this reason, Akomi needs login credentiatls to each of your portals and your EHR.

<Info>
  Someone from Akomi's customer success team will collect the necessary
  credentials from you. **Please use the email, and phone number provided by
  Akomi for all account creation.**
</Info>

# I. Giving access to your EMR

Akomi needs access to your EMR to collect the necessary demographic and clinical information. Please ensure that you
give sufficient access to allow akomi to:

1. View the patient's demographics & encounter data
2. View & download locked and unlocked progress notes
3. View & download other documents in the patient's chart

Once you create the credentials, log into your Akomi account and add the credentials under **Settings** <Icon icon="move-right" iconType="solid" /> **Task Creation** <Icon icon="move-right" iconType="solid" /> **EHR Credentials**.

# II. Giving access to insurance portals

Depending on your payer mix, and/or the different procedures you authorize in your practice, Akomi may need access to some, all, or more of the portals below.
Once you create the credentials for any of the portals, add them to your Akomi account under **Settings** <Icon icon="move-right" iconType="solid" /> **Auth Setup** <Icon icon="move-right" iconType="solid" /> **Insurance Portals Setup**.

<Info>
  While adding the credentials, you can ignore the [2FA and Review before
  submit](https://share.cleanshot.com/hml3Bv7q) options.
